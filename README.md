# REDAPIBOT
This project is a Python-based tool that generates videos from Reddit posts. It fetches a Reddit post (either by URL or from a specified subreddit), converts the text content to speech, overlays synchronized captions, and compiles it with a background video to create a final video output. The tool can be used to create engaging content for platforms like YouTube or social media.
